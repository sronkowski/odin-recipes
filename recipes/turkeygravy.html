<h1>Turkey Gravy</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gravy is the ultimate accompaniment to turkey, but making good gravy is more than just opening a packet and praying for succcess.</p>
<p>The key to any good sauce is a good base, and since our goal for a good gravy is to enhance the natural flavor of turkey, we will start by making a double stock
    using turkey parts.  With this stock made, all that's left is to make a quick roux and reduce to perfection.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>5+ lb assorted turkey parts - you can find smoked turkey necks and tails and many grocery stores</li>
<li>4 onions, finely diced</li>
<li>4 stalks celery, finely diced</li>
<li>6 carrots, finely diced</li>
<li>Fresh sage</li>
<li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Take half of the vegetables, and saute until well-browned.</li>
<li>Add in half of the turkey parts, and saute them until well-browned</li>
<li>Cover all ingredients with enough water to submerge them, and then cook at 15PSI in a pressure cooker for 40 minutes</li>
<li>Let pressure release naturally, and strain stock through a collander to remove turkey parts and vegetables</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-3, but use stock from first round instead of water to cover ingredients - this is called a "double stock"</li>
<li>Pressure cook again at 15PSI for 40 minutes</li>
<li>Strain ingredients, and then filter stock through a paper towel to remove any remaining small bits of food </li>
<li>Make a roux using 4 tbsp flour and 4 tbsp butter</li>
<li>Once roux is made, add a small amount of stock and stir rapidly over medium heat until well-combined</li>
<li>Continue to add stock to roux mixture, waiting for gravy to thicken before adding more</li>
<li>Simmer over low heat, skimming scum off of gravy as needed</li>
<li>Before serving, add salt and pepper to taste</li>

</ol>
